Tobse made a Candy Crush Clone:

As candy crush, the objective of the game is to connect three or more chips of the same type in a row or column to fulfill a score or combine the specified number of chips in a limited number of movements, once connected the chips disappear and the upper chips go down by gravity. You can make chains by using this to get higher scores.
